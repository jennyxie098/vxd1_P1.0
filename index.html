  to show for it. On the Narragansett Bay side, the harbor brims with America’s Cup boats and celebrity yachts. On the Atlantic side, a rugged coastline with legendary surf and Gilded Age mansions. In between, picturesque streets are lined with boutiques, bars with tipsy brides-to-be, and one of the largest collections of colonial-era buildings in the United States. Recently, locals have been reframing Newport’s well-worn nautical narrative with additions like new art galleries and an

and by unveiling, if gradually, the town’s leading role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Lesser-known stories about Newport can be found off-the-beaten path, but with the city’s compact grid, free trolley system, and bike-friendly hotels, car-free wanderers are sure to capture the essence of both worlds.

Guests can pitch in, taking the wheel or trimming the sails, or simply relax with a can of sparkling water. The knowledgeable crew sprinkles in tales about points of interest such as the 1870 <a href="https://roseisland.org/" style="color:#151514">Rose lsland Lighthouse</a> (where you can spend the night) and a red-roofed Victorian mansion where Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy grew up and later had her wedding reception with President John F.
